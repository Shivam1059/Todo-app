# Todo-app
🙌 Hello Linkedin community.

In this week, I am completed my front-end "To Do App" Project.



🔍👨‍💻Idea for my To-Do App stemmed from a desire to simplify my workflow and optimize time management.  I set out to design and develop an intuitive application that would empower users to organize their tasks effortlessly. From conceptualization to execution, every step of the journey was fueled by a passion for creating a practical solution to a common challenge.



Project Overview:

💠 Our To-Do App will have the following features:

💠 Adding tasks to the list.

💠 Marking tasks as completed.

💠 Deleting tasks.

💠 Clearing all completed tasks.

💠 Basic styling for an appealing user interface.



Project set up for using technology :

🔹 index.html: HTML structure for the application.

🔹 styles.css: CSS file for styling.

🔹 script.js: JavaScript file for functionality.
